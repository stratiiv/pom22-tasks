# Django_Forms

Select a project (one of the team members) from the previous sprint and copy the project.

Update POST/PUT methods and templates for adding/editing functionality using Django forms. 


As a result of this sprint (except for the code in the repository) you should get a short video (2-10 minutes) showing
the functionality of the program.
